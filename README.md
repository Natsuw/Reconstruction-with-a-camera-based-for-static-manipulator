This repository demonstrates UR5 move around with different texture model in Gazebo and ROS, then reconstructed in colmap. 

Installation
This project was tested in Ubuntu 18.04 with ROS Melodic, COLMAP-3.6-cuda. 
Make sure you have installed Python2.7 and some useful libraries/packages, such as Numpy, cv2, etc.in ROS.
Install ROS Melodic, Gazebo, RViz, Moveit, official universal robot.
Link for universal robot: universal_robots - ROS Wiki
Link for COLMAP Installation: Installation — COLMAP 3.7 documentation

Install this repository from Source
Firstly, set up a catkin workspace (see this tutorials).
Download official universal robot to workspace, universal_robots - ROS Wiki

Then clone the repository  https://github.com/Natsuw/Reconstruction-with-a-camera-based-for-static-manipulator.git into the src/ folder. It should look like /path/to/your/catkin_ws/… 
Make sure to source the correct setup file according to your workspace hierarchy, then use catkin_make to compile.

Assuming your official universal robot folder is ~/catkin_ws, you should use the following commands:
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src
$ git clone https://github.com/Natsuw/Reconstruction-with-a-camera-based-for-static-manipulator.git
$ cd ..
$ catkin_make
$ source devel/setup.bash

Under catkin_ws/src there are four folders. Two for image saver(xxx_image_saver)
One is the official universal_robot (you should download this folder from official site, the link had provided above) 
And another is ur5_go_pkg (main repository from github).

Replace and Change Files 
Under directory catkin_ws/src/universal_robot/ur_description/urdf/
Opefile ur5_joint_limited_robot.urdf.xacro, and make the following change to the joint limit:
  shoulder_pan_lower_limit="${-2*pi}" shoulder_pan_upper_limit="${2*pi}"

Under directory catkin_ws/src/ur5_go_pkg/src 
There are two folders which are launch and worlds, copy and paste to catkin_ws/src/universal_robot/ur_gazebo

Build the code under directory catkin_ws/
$ catkin_make
$ source devel/setup.bash 

Run the code with ROS and Gazebo 

For the BLOCK model
# launch Gazebo with UR5 and block model 
$ roslaunch ur_gazebo view_test_ur5.launch 
# launch Moveit 
$ roslaunch ur5_moveit_config ur5_moveit_planning_execution.launch sim:=true
# The main file for UR5 run
$ rosrun ur5_go_pkg moveit_block_demo.py
# Save image in ur5_image_save
$ rosrun ur5_go_pkg block_vision.py
# Code are not using, only for testing
roslaunch ur5_moveit_config moveit_rviz.launch config:=true (not using, show in moveit)
rqt_image_view (not using, image view) 

For the Beer model
$ roslaunch ur_gazebo view_beer_ur5.launch 
$ roslaunch ur5_moveit_config ur5_moveit_planning_execution.launch sim:=true
$ rosrun ur5_go_pkg moveit_beer.py
$ rosrun ur5_go_pkg beer_vision.py
